    <p>So, I’m at <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2013">code4lib 2013</a> right now, where side conversations and informal exchanges tend to be the most interesting part.</p>

<p>Last night I had an conversation with the inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/mbklein">Michael B. Klein</a>, and after complaining about faculty members that keep books out for <em>decades</em> at a time, we ended up asking a simple question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much more shelving would we need if everyone returned their books?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming we could get them all checked in and such, well, where would we put them?</p>

<p>I’m looking at this in the simplest, most conservative way possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assume they’re all paperbacks, so we don’t worry about how thick a cover is (cover width = 0)</li>
  <li>Assume items for which we don’t have page count information are “average”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="starting-data">Starting data</h3>

<p>What’s my current situation at Michigan?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total bibs: about 10M (but that includes a bunch of HathiTrust items and other electronic-only items that could never be checked out)</li>
  <li>Total items checked out right now: 162,080</li>
</ul>

<p>The first problem I run into is that I don’t know how many pages are in a given book. Well, in theory I can look in MARC field 300$a, and it will tell me.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-number-of-pages-in-a-book">Finding the number of pages in a book</h3>

<p>I went through a recent dump of all our records and pulled out page counts from the 300 (those that matched the regular expression $$a\d+\s+[pP].).</p>

<p>Problem solved, right? Well, kind of</p>

<ul>
  <li>3,085,433 total bibs with page count data (about 30%)</li>
  <li>40,872 checked out items with page count data (about 25%)</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, so I don’t have data for everything. Plus, some of those are multi-volume works that list the total page count, even though only a single volume may be checked out.</p>

<p>We’ll have to drop down into statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Average number of pages in a checked-out item: 270</li>
  <li>Median number of pages in a checked-out item: 244</li>
</ul>

<p>The median is lower, so we’ll go with that. Being conservative, remember?</p>

<h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together</h3>

<p>Obviously we need to make a lot of assumptions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All paperbacks (== no space allowance for covers)</li>
  <li>244 pages per item (the median of checked out items for which we have data)</li>
  <li>Pages = 244 * 162,080 = 39,547,520 pages</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sowhats-the-damage">So…what’s the damage?</h3>

<p>But how to do the calculation?</p>

<p>It turns out that simply googling <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;noj=1&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=book+spine+width+calculator&amp;oq=book+spine+widt">book spine width calculator</a> a few come up.</p>

<p>I picked one and input 39,547,520 pages and assumed 50lb paper (the lightest paper in the tool).</p>

<p><strong>Total width: 77,241.25 inches, or 6437 feet, or 1.22 miles</strong></p>

<h3 id="miles">1.22 miles???</h3>

<p>Well, we had a lot of assumptions,but most of them were pretty conservative. And I have no idea if the book spine calculator is at all accurate.</p>

<p>But…it’s gonna be a big number no matter what. Add in that many of them are hardcover, and this seems like a pretty good guess at a lower end.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-this-good-for-again">What is this good for again?</h3>

<p>Oh, nothing at all. Just a little fun while I’m at code4lib.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>

<p>Well, the best next step would be to walk away. This is a huge waste of time.</p>

<p>But…we could look in the 020s for a hint of whether it’s hardcover or paperback (which is <a href="http://robotlibrarian.billdueber.com/isbn-parenthetical-notes-bad-marc-data-1/">really hard</a>. And maybe try to figure out if multiple volumes of a multi-volume work are all checked out and take that into account.</p>

<p>But really: this is enough for me. Whether Michael wants to pursue it further on his own, well, that’s up to him.</p>
