<p>I’ve updated and improved the lc normalization code, documented the algorithm, and put it all into <a title="Google Code Repository for LC Normalization algorithm and code" href="http://code.google.com/p/library-callnumber-lc/">Google Code</a>. In the next couple weeks, I’ll be turning it into a Solr text filter so we can do some decent sorting on call-number search results.</p>
