    <p class="post-meta">Mar 4, 2010</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>[This is in response to a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/blacklight-development/browse_thread/thread/672b7269ada16a61?hl=en">thread on the blacklight mailing</a> list about getting MARC data into Solr.]</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-question">What’s the question?</h3>

<p>The question came up, “How much time do we spend processing the MARC vs trying to push it into Solr?”. Bob Haschart found that even with a pretty damn complicated processing stage, pushing the data to solr was still, at best,
taking at least as long as the processing stage.</p>

<p>I’m interested because I’ve been struggling to write a solrmarc-like system that runs under JRuby. Architecturally, the big difference between my stuff and solrmac is that I use the StreamingUpdateSolrServer (on Erik Hatcher’s suggestion). So I thought I’d check how things break down for me.</p>

<p>Here are my numbers running under JRuby (using MARC4J as the marc
implementation) with the Solr StreamingUpdateSolrServer. Obviously, there are
a lot of differences between this and solrmarc, but I’m hoping that while it’s
not comparing apples to apples, it’s at least comparing apples to some sort of
processed cheese-like product.</p>

<h3 id="what-work-is-being-done-on-what">What work is being done on what?</h3>

<p>The data set is a file of 18,881 MARC records in marc-binary format. It’s
probably not big enough to get a great idea of how things will run over the
long (many millions of records) haul, but it’ll do for this rough-cut stuff.</p>

<p>I break my processing down into five categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read the records into marc4j objects and do nothing. This is a baseline of sorts.</li>
  <li>The “normal” fields are anything that you could do with SolrMarc without a
custom routine; the actual processing is done in JRuby.</li>
  <li>Custom fields are generated with JRuby code, but these are things that in solmarc would require a custom routine.</li>
  <li>The big “allfields” field is text from tags 100 through 900.</li>
  <li>The “to_xml” routine is just calling the underlying marc4j XML output and stuffing it into a string.</li>
</ul>

<p>The schema used is our normal UMICH schema <em>except for</em> High Level Browse
(which appear in the <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/">our catalog</a> as “Academic
Discipline”). The code for that is written in Java, and I just call it from
JRuby when I’m using it. I excluded it because it’s incredibly expensive, both at startup time (when it loads a giant database of call-number ranges and associated categories) and for processing – there’s a lot of call-number normalization, long-string comparisons, some modified binary searches, etc. etc. etc. It’s expensive. Trust me.</p>

<p>The Solr server itself is on a different, incredibly-beefy machine, and is
emptied out before each invocation that involves actually pushing data to it (with a delete-by-query <em>:</em>).</p>

<h3 id="how-fast-were-things-on-my-desktop">How fast were things on my desktop?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>18,881 records in marc-binary format</li>
  <li>Times are in seconds, run on my desktop</li>
  <li>Remember, you can’t compare these numbers to Bob’s because we’re doing
different things to different data.</li>
</ul>

    <tr>

      <td>send to solr with one thread</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="why-does-solr-processing-seem-so-much-faster-for-me">Why does solr processing seem so much faster for me?</h3>

<p>There are a lot of reasons why my submit-to-solr might seem like less of a
burden. The ones I can think of off the top of my head are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SUSS is just faster than whatever solrmarc does.</li>
  <li>My processing stage is so much slower than solrmac’s (due to algorithms or jruby-vs-java, I don’t know) that the “push to solr” portion of it gets swallowed up by the slowness of the of overall code.</li>
  <li>The Solr server is so much faster than my desktop that my poor little
desktop can’t send it data fast enough to work it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For my setup, obviously adding a processing thread is a lot more beneficial
than adding a SUSS thread.</strong> My desktop doesn’t have that many threads lying around (adding a third processing thread actually slowed things down), so I moved the code to a beefier machine to see what happened.</p>

<h3 id="trying-the-same-thing-on-a-beefy-machine">Trying the same thing on a beefy machine</h3>

<p>This is the exact same code and data, but on a beefy machine (16 cores, gobs
of memory).</p>

<p>So, on my hardware anyway, there’s a sweet spot with one suss thread and
three processing threads. YMMV, of course.</p>

<h3 id="what-have-we-learned">What have we learned?</h3>

<p>I’m not sure, to be honest. It’s logistically difficult for me to do the same
process in solrmarc because I’d have to rebuild everything without the HLB stuff. I guess for me, what I’ve learned that if I’m going to continue working
on my code, the places to focus my attention are threading (obviously) and MARC-XML generation.</p>
