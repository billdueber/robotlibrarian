The good folks at <a href="http://www.tictocs.ac.uk">ticToc</a>s heard the call for open data, and they responded...exactly as I asked them to. Which makes me think I should have asked for a pony, too, but I'm still very, very happy!

Anyone can now download a <a href="http://www.tictocs.ac.uk/text.php">simple tab-delimited text file</a> describing all the journal table of contents RSS files they've assembled, for use however anyone wants.

The data include issns and eissns (where available), the title of the journal, and of course the URL of the RSS/Atom/Whatever feed.

The feeds themselves are all over the map -- it's whatever the publisher decides to provide, which might includeÂ  abstract/volume/number/doi, or might just be the title of the article. But regardless, they represent data that are useful to our patron and are now available in a format that's easy to exploit.

So...go to it?
