<blockquote><strong>DANGER!</strong>

<strong>I was trying to re-verify my numbers and found a glaring and hugely important mistake. I'll make a new post with the details, but basically I was counting about 180k sessions (out of only 735k) that I should have been ignoring. Please ignore my basic stats until further notice.</strong>

<strong>See the<a href="http://robotlibrarian.billdueber.com/corrected-code4lib-slides-are-up/"> new numbers and corrected slides</a> for more accurate data.</strong></blockquote>
===============

I did a little Lightning Talk at <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2011/">Code4Lib 2011 </a>and cleaned up (and heavily annotated) my slides for anyone interested in them.

The focus was on some basic stats about usage of our OPAC, <a href="http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/">Mirlyn</a>, in calendar 2010.

I'll be doing some posts and/or more rigorous writing on this stuff soon, but wanted to get these up in a timely fashion.
