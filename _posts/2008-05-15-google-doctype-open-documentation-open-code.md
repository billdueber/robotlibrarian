Because you can never have too many open encyclopedia-type-thingies, Google has launched
[Google Doctype](http://code.google.com/doctype/), a "Google-sponsored open encyclopedia and reference library for developers of web applications. By web developers, for web developers." It's set up to use an open license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a>) and, unlike other similar resources, is explicitly set up to include code for testing and browser-compatibility tables generated by running that code against different browsers. Simple, direct... what's not to like?
