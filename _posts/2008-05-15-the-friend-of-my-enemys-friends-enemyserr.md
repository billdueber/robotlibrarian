Move over, Axis of Evil! Our 43rd president, George W. Bush (and you gotta know that his dad hangs on to that 'H.' with two white-knuckled hands) is now in search of "[the surest way to defeat the enemies of hatred.](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hkf--m78S6F3LZAcz4sVHGGCQSTgD90LMAR00)" Of course, we're the best of friends with hatred here at Robot Librarian, so we should be safe.
