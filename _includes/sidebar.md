Hi. I'm Bill Dueber.

I have been a Systems Librarian at the [University of Michigan Univeristy Library](http://lib.umich.edu/) since 2007. I've got a great wife, three kids (whose greatness comes and goes), and a home I adore in Ann Arbor, MI.

I usually represent myself online as *billdueber* (e.g., on [github](http://github.com/billdueber/), [twitter](http://twitter.com/billdueber) and the [code4lib IRC channel](http://code4lib.org/irc), and you can email me at &lt;firstname&gt; at &lt;lastname&gt;.com.
