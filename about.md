I have been a Systems Librarian at the [University of Michigan Univeristy Library](http://lib.umich.edu/) since 2007. I've got a great wife, three kids (whose greatness comes and goes), and a home I adore in Ann Arbor, MI.

### Stuff I do at work

I spend much of my work time dealing with [Mirlyn](http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/), the library catalog. It's currently a PHP front-end and a [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) backend, although any and all of those components may be likely to change as we start doing things differently around here.

I'm also in charge of [the metadata catalog for the HathiTrust](http://catalog.hathitrust.org/). In both cases, I prepare stuff for indexing into Solr using a JRuby-based system called [traject](http://github.com/traject-project/traject/), which at its core is a basic [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) system, but which we've built a lot of MARC-centric niceties into.

I also contribute to MARC libraries for [ruby](http://github.com/ruby-marc/), [java](http://github.com/marc4j/), and [perl](http://search.cpan.org/~gmcharlt/MARC-Record-2.0.6/) although I really only use the ruby stuff in any consistent way.

Just about everything I do makes it into [my github repo](http://github.com/billdueber/) sooner or later. Some of what's there is old and crusty; other stuff is more useful. Library-types may be interested in [code to deal with standard identifiers](https://github.com/billdueber/library_stdnums) or a [solr analyzer for normalzing ISBNs and LCCNs](https://github.com/billdueber/solr-libstdnum-normalize).



### Stuff I do not at work

Mostly, I take care of my kids, cook a tiny little bit, feel bad about not cooking more, and go out on dates with my wife whenever I can. I also play some volleyball and like to sing, but the former is sporadic and the latter usually only in the car.
