The short bio: I grew up in Minnesota, got a degree in Computer Science from [Gustavus Adolphus College](http://www.gac.edu/), and went on to get MS's from Indiana University in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/) and [Instructional Systems Technology](http://education.indiana.edu/about/departments/instructional/). The latter was supposed to turn into a Ph.D. at some point, but like so many before me I got burned out and left a.b.d.

The good news is that I got married to [my beautiful, talented wife](http://www.danitbrown.com/) in the meantime and picked up an incredibly fulfilling job at the [University of Michigan Library System](http://www.lib.umich.edu/). Part of my duties center on the creation, care, and feeding of two library catalogs: [Mirlyn](http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu), the UMich catalog, and the catalog for [the Hathitrust](http://www.hathitrust.org/).

I've got three boys, a great house, and some of the most ridiculously smart co-workers on the planet.

Like so many nerds before me, I spend a lot of time reading, writing, and creating software libraries.

And my birthday is July 19<sup>th</sup>. If, you know, you wanted to send flowers or something.
